smartRack
- a web app for the smart Rack project, made for a friend's university project (I know the code is a huge mess, so don't judge, I just wanna get this done quickly)
- there are some known issues in the project that I won't fix since it is sufficient for demonstration purposes.
- the user login and signup are dummies; all users will only be able to control 1 device. The login and signup features are made only to meet the group leader's requirements anyway.
